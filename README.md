It's full featured DAW with classical multitrack + tracker + some live stuff 
The official page is [mak-sa.net/software](http://mak-sa.net/software)

Please be patient. This is a beta version. I would be very grateful if you could give me some feedback. Since this is a one-man project I don't have much time for testing. So I would be happy to receive any information about errors. Also, please write about what and how can be done better.
